Version 2.6 has just reached stable and 2.7 is now considered beta and will be stabilized soon. WorkManager 2.6 is a fully packed feature release. Instead of WorkManager's own initialization provider it uses App Startup. This means you'll have to update the way you removed the default content provider for WorkManagerHowever, WorkManager 2.6 is missing one key piece for apps targeting Android 12 (API level 31). Starting in Android 12, foreground service launch restrictions were introduced. These restrictions can leave your app in a state where calling setForeground may cause an exception. With WorkManager 2.7 expedited jobs were introduced. Expedited jobs allow apps to execute short and high-priority tasks while giving the system better control over access to resources. Expedited jobs are the recommended way to start a task from the background. We introduced the setExpedited API that is designed to cover most use cases. There are some exceptions for when an app is not subject to foreground service restrictions. The most obvious is, when your app is visible to the user. All other cases are documented here..

If you're following best practices with Auto Layout and size classes, your app's interface will dynamically adapt to the new dimensions. However, if you've added UIRequiresFullScreen=YES to your app's Info.plist in order to keep your app full screen during multitasking, you'll need to recompile with Xcode 13 and the SDK for iPadOS 15 to take advantage of the full screen size.
